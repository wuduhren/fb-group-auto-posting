# Requirement
I am using python 3.7, but I think python3 will do the work.  
This code is tested on MacOS. Not sure on other platform.

# Install & Run
```
$ pip install selenium
$ pip install webdriver-manager
# Set the variable in main.py: account, password, groups
# Run main.py
```

# Other things
1. The code is base on this amazing [repo](https://github.com/HighVoltages/Facebook-group-automation-python---Web-Automation), but I think it is out dated.
2. Use this to share good stuff. Do not spam!
